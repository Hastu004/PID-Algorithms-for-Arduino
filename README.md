Estudio comparativo de algoritmos de control PID clásico para el control angular de un brazo electromecánico

Comparative study of classical PID control algorithms for the angular control of an electromechanical arm

ABSTRACT

According to various reports, it is estimated that around 70% of industrial control loops use the classical PID control algorithms (Proportional Integral Derivative), the most used of them is the Parallel PID, but there are variants such as serial PID, I-PD and PI-D, each of them has different properties. In this study, the performance of these diverse implementations is evaluated in an angular control plant that consists of an arm manipulated by a Brushless motor. For the angular control of the arm, the various implementations of PID controllers reported in the literature were tested, obtaining the value of their parameters according to the model of the plant. In order to design the algorithms it was necessary to discretize the differential equations that define the PID controllers, transforming their differential equations to equations of differences which were later programmed in C ++. In a first instance, the control schemes were implemented in simulation mode to subsequently implement them in real time. The results obtained were quite similar and the subsequent evaluation of the various implementations tested showed that the parallel PID algorithm fulfilled the control objectives more effectively.
